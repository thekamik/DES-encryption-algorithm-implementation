# DES Encryption Algorithm in C++

This project is a C++ implementation of the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**, a symmetric-key algorithm for secure data encryption. It is designed to provide a foundational understanding of encryption mechanisms and showcases how DES operates.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Implements core DES functions for data encryption and decryption.
- **Modern C++ Standards:** Built with C++23, leveraging modern language features for clarity and performance.
- **Modular Design:** Organized with separate directories for headers and source files for better maintainability.

## TODOs
- Add functionality to encrypt and decrypt strings.
- Handle file encryption.

## Prerequisites
CMake 3.10 or newer.
A C++23 compatible compiler.
